<h3>Luca Wellmeier's Resume</h3>

<blockquote>
Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.
<cite>Richard Feynman (1965).</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  I am an aspiring <strong>applied mathematician</strong> 
  currently searching for the work environment that 
  fits me best.
  I love harmonic analysis and probability theory
  and use them as tools to unravel 
  the myths of deep learning and 
  to invent new mathematically sound 
  ML/DL methods.
  I wrote two theses (MSc and honors college) 
  on the phenomena of 
  benign overfitting and double descent
  via kernel methods as a potent study proxy 
  for neural nets and on their own right.
  Particular focus was on Sobolev kernels.

  I have professional experiences
  in GPU and graphics programming 
  (especially for synthetic data generation),
  academic experiences in machine and 
  deep learning experimentation, 
  and hobby experiences in much more areas.
