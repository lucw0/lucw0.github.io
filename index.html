    I am an aspiring <strong>applied mathematician</strong>
    currently searching for the work environment that
    fits me best.
    I love harmonic analysis and probability theory
    and use them as tools to unravel
    the myths of deep learning and
    to invent new mathematically sound
    ML/DL methods.
    I wrote two theses (MSc and honors college)
    on the phenomena of
    benign overfitting and double descent
    via kernel methods as a potent study proxy
    for neural nets and on their own right.
    Particular focus was on Sobolev kernels.

    I am also a capable, self-taught 
    <strong>software developer</strong> 
    with strong senses for clean code
    and hardware efficiency.
    My main tools of trade are C, C++ and Python with 
    their respective ecosystems.
    I have professional experiences
    in GPU and graphics programming 
    (especially for synthetic data generation),
    academic experiences in machine and 
    deep learning experimentation, 
    and hobby experiences in many other areas.
